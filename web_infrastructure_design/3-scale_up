Overview

This document outlines a web infrastructure design featuring a load balancer, separate servers for web applications, and a database. The architecture enhances performance, scalability, and reliability.
Infrastructure Components

    Load Balancer (HAproxy):
        Purpose: Distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers, preventing any single server from becoming a bottleneck. This ensures better resource utilization and improved availability.
        Configuration: Configured as a cluster with at least one other load balancer to provide failover and redundancy.

    Web Server:
        Purpose: Handles HTTP/S requests from clients and serves static content (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images) directly to the user. It also forwards dynamic requests to the application server.
        Separation: By splitting the web server from the application server, each component can be optimized for its specific function.

    Application Server:
        Purpose: Executes the web applicationâ€™s business logic, processes dynamic requests, interacts with the database, and generates the content sent to the user.
        Separation: Isolating the application server from the web server enhances security and performance, allowing each server to handle specific workloads without interference.

    Database Server:
        Purpose: Manages data storage, retrieval, and manipulation for the web application. It stores user data, application settings, and other critical information.
        Separation: By using a dedicated database server, performance is optimized for data-intensive operations, and database management can be handled independently from application logic.

Benefits of This Infrastructure

    Scalability: Each component can be scaled independently based on demand. For example, if traffic increases, you can add more web servers without affecting the application or database servers.

    Improved Performance: With dedicated servers for each component, resources can be allocated efficiently, resulting in faster response times and better overall performance.

    Enhanced Reliability: The load balancer provides redundancy and failover capabilities, reducing the risk of downtime. If one server fails, the load balancer can redirect traffic to another server seamlessly.

Conclusion

This infrastructure design ensures optimal performance, scalability, and reliability for hosting web applications. By clearly defining the roles of each component and separating their functionalities, we create a robust environment that can adapt to changing demands while maintaining high availability.
